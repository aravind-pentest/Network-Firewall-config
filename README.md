# Firewall Configuration Task on Kali Linux

## Objective:
Configure and test basic firewall rules using UFW on Kali Linux to allow or block traffic.

## What I did:
1. Enabled UFW firewall and checked its status.
2. Added a rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet).
3. Tested the rule by trying to connect to port 23 locally (connection refused).
4. Added a rule to allow SSH traffic on port 22.
5. Verified the rules applied successfully.
6. Took screenshots of the firewall status and test results.

## How firewall filters traffic:
The firewall filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on rules that allow or block traffic on specific ports and protocols. By default, incoming traffic is denied unless explicitly allowed.

## Files included:
- Screenshots showing firewall rules and test results.
- This README file explaining the task steps.
